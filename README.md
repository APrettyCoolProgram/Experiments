# Repository Template

</div>

This repository is a reusable starting point for GitHub repositories. It collects a root README, alternate README
templates, standard supporting documentation, and GitHub metadata so a new repository can start with a consistent 
structure instead of an empty scaffold.

## Contents

- [What this repository includes](#what-this-repository-includes)
- [Using the template](#using-the-template)
- [Repository layout](#repository-layout)
- [Supporting documentation](#supporting-documentation)

## What this repository includes

- A root README for the template repository itself.
- [README-REPO.md](README-REPO.md) as an alternate root README for this template repository.
- [Collection-README.md](Collection-README.md) for collection-style repositories.
- [SourceCode-README.md](SourceCode-README.md) for software or source-code repositories.
- A [docs](docs) folder containing common repository documents including the changelog, roadmap, development
  notes, testing, support, security guidance, FAQ, and troubleshooting guidance.
- A [src](src) folder for source code organization.
- A [.github](.github) folder for repository assets, workspace data, and repository-specific metadata.

## Using the template

1. Create a new repository from this template, or copy the parts you want into an existing repository.
2. Decide which README variant best matches the new repository:
   - Use [Collection-README.md](Collection-README.md) for repositories that primarily collect links, notes, or
     documentation.
   - Use [SourceCode-README.md](SourceCode-README.md) for repositories that contain buildable software or other
     source code.
3. Copy the selected README template into the target repository as `README.md` and replace the placeholder text,
   badges, links, screenshots, and release details.
4. Review the files in [docs](docs) and remove any documents the new repository does not need.
5. Update the repository assets under [.github/repository](.github/repository), especially the logo and README
   screenshots, so the new repository branding matches the project.
6. Add the `.do-not-commit/` folder to `.github/`
7. Clean up any template-only content before publishing.

## Repository layout

Your repository should look like this:

```text
